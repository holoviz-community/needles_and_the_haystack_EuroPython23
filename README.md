To run:

```
$ conda install anaconda-project
$ anaconda-project run notebook
```

Note this is using a dev version of HoloViews for instant inspection.

The t-SNE example will be added to
[pyviz-topics](https://github.com/holoviz-topics/examples) and and
earlier version of ship traffic (which will be updated to demonstrate
instant inspection) can be found
[here](https://github.com/holoviz-topics/examples/tree/main/ship_traffic).
