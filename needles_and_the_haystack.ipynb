    "\n",
    "* Data is cheap and plentiful but insight is expensive.\n",
    "* Most plotting tools are not designed to visualize gigabytes of data at a time.\n",
    "* *Overplotting* is one problem that arises as data density increases.\n",
    "* Expressing *large dynamic ranges* in the data can also be a problem as sample densities increase.\n",
    "* WebGL approaches (e.g. [`jupyter_scatter`](https://github.com/flekschas/jupyter-scatter)) improve the situation but are limited to the memory and compute resources of a browser tab\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datashader (datashader.org)\n",
    " \n",
    "In 2016, the datashader project set out to see if visualizing billions of samples at once in a meaningful way was possible. Using numba (numba.org) for speed, datashader demonstrated that meaningful, beautiful visualizations were indeed feasible. Here are some examples:\n",

    "\n",

    "Datashader solves the two key problems with large data as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overplotting: samples are *rasterized* to an image on screen by representing the data as a 2D histogram.\n",
    "* Large dynamic range (parameter-free): colormapping using *histogram equalization* makes much better use of colormaps without having any parameters to tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these are certainly pretty images in which you can spot patterns, it is not possible to query the data in any meaningful way (as these are static images).\n",

    "Since the initial release of datashader in 2016, the HoloViz ecosystem has worked to make interactive plotting features available for working with large datasets. With the addition of client-side `eq_hist` colormapping in Bokeh, the new `inspect` operation and instant hover, it is now possible to work with large data in the same way as you can currently work with smaller datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you can see *all* your data (gigabytes at a time) while also allowing you to interactively link and drilldown to view the detailed information for subsets and individual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course there are always more improvements in progress that will be available soon:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bokeh now supports categorical color mixing! This feature will be available in `holoviews` and `hvplot` soon:\n",
